# Kod
The ultimate programming language! Write code like danish sentences.

# How to use
Generate the assembly file by running `runhaskell Compiler.hs < file.kod`.
This will generate the `out.asm`file which then can be assembled and linked with `-./compile.sh`

Ekampels of Kod code can be seen in the test files besides `test` which is currently translated
too norwegian. This will be fixed later.
